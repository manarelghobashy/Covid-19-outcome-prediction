# Covid-19-outcome-prediction
## AI / ML project

## Description
This project uses multiple classification algorithms to classify a dataset 
containing daily information on the number of affected cases, deaths,
and recovery from the 2019 novel coronavirus. These different classifiers
will be used to determine whether or not a person will recover from 
coronavirus symptoms based on specific pre-defined standard 
symptoms. These symptoms are based on World Health Organization 
recommendations (WHO). The data is available from 22 January 2020. 
Data is in the “data.csv” file.

## Table of contents:

- Reading and visualizing data.
- Build K-Nearest Neighbors classifier.
- Build a Logistic Regression classifier.
- Build Naïve Bayes classifier.
- Build Decision Trees classifier.
- Build Support Vector Machines classifier.
